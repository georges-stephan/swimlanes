# About the Project
I started this project as part of an exercise in learning the Python programming language.

This project aims to mimic some of the functionalities of the engine operating swimlanes.io. The difference is that the output generated by this program is in raster format (SVG) instead of bitmap.

The other constraint is to avoid, as much as possible, any dependency on any library (because I am still learning). The only library I am using is called Pillow, and I use it to measure the dimension of a text given font size.

# Requirements
The Python version I am using to develop this project is 3.10.0.

# Running the Program
The main class is `ui.MainUI`, so this is the class you want to execute. I am using the `tkinter` UI framework. Execute:
```
Python ui.MainUI
```
From the root directory of this project to run the program. Windows users can link a shortcut to `swimlanes.vbs` instead
of using the command line.
