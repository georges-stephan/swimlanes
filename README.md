# swimlanes

I started this project as an exercise to discover the Python programming language. The excercise is to mimic sopme of the fonctionalities of the engine operating at swimlanes.io. The difference is that the output is generated as an SVG image.
The other constraint is avoid, as much as possible the dependency on any library. The only dependency is IamgeFont from Pillow.
