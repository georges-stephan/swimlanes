# About the Project
I started this project as part of an exercise in learning the Python programming language.

This project aims to mimic some functionalities of the engine operating swimlanes.io. The difference is that the output generated by this program is in raster format (SVG) instead of bitmap.

As an example, given this input:
```
title: Pizza Delivery

Customer -> Pizza Call Center: Pizza Order

Pizza Call Center -> Kitchen: Pizza Order

Kitchen -->> Customer: Pizza is Cooking Notification

Kitchen -> Kitchen: Prepare Pizza

Kitchen -> Driver: Pizza is Ready

Driver -> Customer: Hot Pizza
note:
The driver quickly rides his
bike to the customer's house

order: Customer, Driver, Pizza Call Center,Kitchen
```

The following SVG image will be generated:

The other constraint is to avoid, as much as possible, any dependency on any library (because I am still learning). The only library I am using is called Pillow, for measuring the dimension of a text given font size, Yaml to read configuration files and setuptools for the build.

# Requirements
The Python version I am using to develop this project is 3.11.4.

# Defining a Template
A Template is a JSON file which, when provided as a command line argument, will allow you to determine the colors of the elements in the generated graph. The example below lists the currently available parameters:
```json
{
  "arrow_height": 10,
  "arrow_stroke_width": 1,
  "arrow_color":"black",
  "body-font-family": "sans-serif",
  "body-font-size": 14,
  "background_color": "white",
  "connection_line_color": "black",
  "space_between_connections": 50,
  "stroke_width": 2,
  "task_fill_color": "white",
  "task_height": 50,
  "task_line_color": "grey",
  "task_width": 150,
  "task_text_color": "black",
  "text_margin-bottom": 4,
  "text_margin-left": 4,
  "text_margin-right": 4,
  "text_margin-top": 4,
  "title-font-family": "sans-serif",
  "title-font-size": 16,
  "x_offset": 50,
  "y_offset": 70,
  "note_line_color":"rgb(221, 219, 204)",
  "note_fill_color":"rgb(255, 253, 238)",
  "note_text_color":"black"
}
```

# Running the Program
The main class is `ui.MainUI`, so this is the class you want to execute. I am using the `tkinter` UI framework. Execute:
```
pythonw -m ui.MainUI
```
From the root directory of this project to run the program. Windows users can link a shortcut to `swimlanes.vbs` instead
of using the command line. This will use the default color template. To force the program to use specific template, run:
```
pythonw -m ui.MainUI /path/to/template.json
```

Below is a screenshot of the UI:
