# swimlanes

I started this project as an exercise to discover the Python programming language. The goal of this excercise is to mimic some of the fonctionalities of the engine operating swimlanes.io. The difference is that the output is generated as an SVG image.
The other constraint is avoid, as much as possible any dependency on any library. The only dependency is IamgeFont from Pillow which is used to measure the dimension of a text given a font size.
